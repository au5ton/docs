# docs
Documentation for the undocumented. For more information, check out the Wiki tab. All of the documentation is done there.

## Purpose

Say you want to make an app for a site that doesn't officially have an API, well you have to know how it works, right?

Here I have documentation for various things I've found that don't have an official API, but you can still work with it to a degree.

## I want a copy of this. Can I clone the wiki?

In addition to viewing the information online on the wiki, you can clone the wiki portion of this repository with:

##### `git clone https://github.com/au5ton/docs.wiki.git`
